# turing
A turing machine implementation written to run programs from the book _Annotated Turing_.

## What does it do?
The program is an interpreter for _m-configurations_ to be executed by a turing machine. It translates these to bytecode, and then executes the bytecode on a small virtual machine.

## How do I write programs?
To ease the process of writing one of these programs, I wrote an interpreter that churns out bytecode(?) that the virtual machine can run.
It takes in code formated like this:
```
print0: none | P0, R | print1
print1: none | P1, R | print0
```
This particular program will print alternating 1s and 0s.
### Formatting

Turing machines work on a series of *m-configurations*. Each of these configurations contain information about which operations to perform for different symbols, and which configuration to move like next.
Here is an *m-configuration* from the snippet above, called `print0`, which fittingly will print the value `0` into the current position in memory.

```
print0: none | P0, R | print1
```

Each configuration consists of one or more branches, separated by semicolons. Each of these branches consists of three fields, sperated by vertical bars `|`, that define it. These contain the _symbol_ the branch reacts to, the _operations_ to perform for the branch and the name of the _next configuration_.

Also note that it is ok for names to have spaces in them for readability, and configurations can safely be terminated with semicolons for a coherent look.

```
print 0 or 1: none | P0, R | print 0 or 1; else | P1, R | print 1;
```

#### Symbols
The first field contains a _symbol_. When an _m-configuration_ is executed, a _symbol_ is read from memory, and a branch is selected if its symbol corresponds to the one that is read.

In the snippet above, the symbols used were `none` and `else`. These are two special keywords, corresponding to a blank piece of memory and "any symbol" respectively. Other than these, all ascii characters are valid symbols, except for `0` and `Ã¿` (which are used internally to represend `none` and `else`).

#### Operations
The next fields contain the operations to perform for the current branch. This can be a series of several operations, separated by commas. The defined operations are:
| Operation | Description |
|-|-|
| N | Do nothing, or _halt_ as it is called in some litterature |
| P_ | Print the following ascii symbol (like P1) |
| E | Erase the symbol of the current pointer position |
| R | Move pointer location to the right |
| L | Move pointer location to the left |

#### Next
The final value is the name of the next *m-configuration* to move to.

### Example
The following is a simple example from _Annotated Turing_, which produces the decimals in binary for the fraction 1/4.
```
b: none | P0, R | c
c: none | R     | d
d: none | P1, R | e
e: none | R     | f
f: none | P0, R | e

```

## Running programs
At the moment, programs have to be run from the main function.. I will change this so that they can be read by the executable and interpreted on the fly.

## Other info / setting up
This is currently set up for development in Windows, using MSVC, in a partition `W:` with a folder `build` in the root. Running `shell.bat` will add `cl` to your path. Running `build.bat` will then compile the program. You can just compile it in place, but this is useful for debugging.. I promise.

## TODO

- Interactive running would be fun. Like manually moving forward in the exeuction, seeing the branch being executed, the tape moving..
- Uh oh! The tape is a piece of memory. This means that it is very much _not_ infinite in either direction. I will have to see if I can find a reasonable way to move backwards in memory, perhaps allocating more memory dynamically.. We will see.
- Add more examples! I will type out the sqrt(2)/2 example from the book when printing works, so I can verify that it works..
- Write a Makefile.. I am currently using an archaic and mystical `build.bat` file that i run in Windows cmd, but I can write this. If not just use `cl` or any compiler for c++ you have lying around..
- Change c library functions to use safe versions.. This is currently a hot memory mess.
