# turing
A turing machine implementation written to run programs from the book _Annotated Turing_.

## What does it do?
The program is an interpreter for _m-configurations_ to be executed by a turing machine. It translates these to bytecode, and then executes the bytecode on a small virtual machine.

## How do I write programs?
To ease the process of writing one of these programs, I wrote an interpreter that churns out bytecode(?) that the virtual machine can run.
It takes in code formated like this:
```
print0: none | P0, R | print1
print1: none | P1, R | print0
```
This particular program will print alternating 1s and 0s.
### Formatting

Turing machines work on a series of *m-configurations*. Each of these configurations contain information about which operations to perform for different symbols, and which configuration to move like next.
Here is an *m-configuration* from the snippet above, called `print0`, which fittingly will print the value `0` into the current position in memory.

```
print0: none | P0, R | print1
```

Each configuration consists of one or more branches, separated by semicolons. Each of these branches consists of three fields, sperated by vertical bars `|`, that define it. These contain the _symbol_ the branch reacts to, the _operations_ to perform for the branch and the name of the _next configuration_.

Also note that it is ok for names to have spaces in them for readability, and configurations can safely be terminated with semicolons for a coherent look.

```
print 0 or 1: none | P0, R | print 0 or 1; else | P1, R | print 1;
```

#### Symbols
The first field contains a _symbol_. When an _m-configuration_ is executed, a _symbol_ is read from memory, and a branch is selected if its symbol corresponds to the one that is read.

_Symbols_ in this case denotes ascii characters and the keywords `none` and `else`. `none` represents a blank piece of memory, and `else` means the branch matches any symbol read.
It is worth noting here that `Ã¿` (`0xFF`) is not a valid symbol, as it is used to represent `else` internally. Neither can you actually refer to the _space_ symbol in a configuration, but the `none` keyword translates literally to a space (`0x20`), so that is no issue. Other than that, all sensible ascii letters should be usable.

#### Operations
The next fields contain the operations to perform for the current branch. This can be a series of several operations, separated by commas. The defined operations are:
| Operation | Description |
|-|-|
| N | Do nothing, or _halt_ as it is called in some litterature |
| P_ | Print the following ascii symbol (like P1) |
| E | Erase the symbol of the current pointer position |
| R | Move pointer location to the right |
| L | Move pointer location to the left |

#### Next
The final value is the name of the next *m-configuration* to move to.

### Example
The following is a simple example from _Annotated Turing_, which produces the decimals in binary for the fraction 1/4.
```
b: none | P0, R | c
c: none | R     | d
d: none | P1, R | e
e: none | R     | f
f: none | P0, R | e

```

## Running programs
At the moment, programs have to be run from the main function.. I will change this so that they can be read by the executable and interpreted on the fly.

## Setting up
Simply run `make` to compile the executable. You can then run it with the file to interpret and the number of passes to make, like this:
```
make
turing.exe example.tur 10 // on windows
turing example.tur 10 // on linux/macos
```
Just change the makefile to fit your needs, for instance if you want to use a different compiler.


## TODO
- Interactive running would be fun. Like manually moving forward in the exeuction, seeing the branch being executed, the tape moving..
- Uh oh! The tape is a piece of memory. This means that it is very much _not_ infinite in either direction. I will have to see if I can find a reasonable way to move backwards in memory, perhaps allocating more memory dynamically.. We will see.
- Add more examples! I will type out the sqrt(2)/2 example from the book when printing works, so I can verify that it works..
- Emoji support???
