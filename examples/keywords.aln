! Here we have a simple program demonstrating the
! three keywords in the Alan language:
! 'none', 'any' and 'else'.

! 'none' will match to a blank space on memory

! 'any' will, perhaps confusingly, match
! to either '0' or '1'. The keyword 'either' could
! be used instead, but 'any' was chosen
! to conform with the examples in Annotated Turing.

! Finally, there is 'else'. This works much like
! the 'else' keyword in any other programming language,
! and will simply match to any character if
! none of the ones preceding it match.

begin: none | P1, R2, P0 | next

next: any  | R2      | next
      else | P0, R2 | next
