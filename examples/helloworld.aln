! This program prints 'hello world'
! into the tape

! It utilises passing several characters
! to the P function, which implicitly
! right-shifts twice between each
! symbol it prints

! We also use markers to denote which
! character we came from, in order to
! only have one configuration for each
! character we want to write. This way,
! we can use branches to select which
! letter to print next
