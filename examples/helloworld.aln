! This example will print the string
! "hello world" onto the tape if it is
! run with 16 passes.

! It utilises passing a longer string
! of values to the P function,
! which will print each value with
! a space between.

! This conforms to how turing
! explained how things should be
! laid out on the tape in his paper.
! The spaces between 1s and 0s should
! be used for "marking" the previous
! value.

! In this example, this marking is
! used to denote which value we were
! at previously. From this, the configuration
! determines which branch to go to,
! and in turn which value that should
! be printed next. This way, we can have
! one configuration for each letter, and
! just use different branches to determine
! which letter to print next

! This could be written more concisely,
! but I wanted to very explicitly show
! how marking is done, by moving back
! one space and printing the marker value,
! for instance 'E' in the 'mark e'-configuration.
