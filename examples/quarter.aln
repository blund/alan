! This example will print out
! the binary point values for
! the number 1/4, or 0.25.
! Here we see that the placement
! of the numbers matters;
! Only every other value is
! interpreted as the result
! of the computation, as
! their neighbours are used
! to 'mark' the values in
! more complex configurations,
! such as in half_sqrt_two.aln.

a: none | P0, R2 | b
b: none | P1, R2 | c
c: none | P0, R2 | c
