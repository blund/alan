! This is a simple program that
! prints the value of 1/4, e.g. 0.25
! in binary onto the pieces of memory that
! will be printed.

! Note that keywords and branching are not
! used, as this is an early example from
! Annotated Turing used to describe
! what configurations are.

! If you want, try rewriting this to
! use the built in keywords, and
! perhaps even using branching!
! It should be possible to do in
! 2 lines, and a single configuration.

! Also note that the result is stored as a
! binary fraction, and printed
! by the interpreter as a floating
! point value.

b: none | P0, R | c
c: none | R     | d
d: none | P1, R | e
e: none | R     | f
f: none | P0, R | e
